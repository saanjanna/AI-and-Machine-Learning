The dataset explained in the coursework  represents a machine leaning model for Breast Cancer. The  machine learning model is compared with two models such as support vector machine and decision tree, and deep  learning model convolution neural network. One of the machine learning model (Convolutional neural network)is based on deep learning architecture and implemented using keras python library. The dataset is pre-processed  such as data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and it is implemented using evaluation and tuning the model. The hybrid machine learning model  for breast cancer dataset reported better results using decision tree model with accuracy of 91.13% compared to Support vector machine and deep learning model.
